  <h1>Welcome To Rob's Programming Portfolio</h1>
  <h2> 
    Hello! My name is Rob Renovales and I have always been interested in coding. I am a father to a 7 year old boy! One of my favorite hobbies is gaming;<br>
    it always keeps me busy when I have nothing to do and enjoy finding solutions to many puzzles. Back in high school, <br>
    I use to tinker around with programs that allowed me to create my own mini games, such as, creating games through flash.<br>
    Another one of my hobbies; going outside and enjoying a nice hike. Being cooked up indoors all day can be tiring and sometimes <br>
    enjoying the weather outside can be a great way to get a little exercise, as well as, enjoying the beautiful scenery. I am also <br>
    Bi-lingual and can speak both Spanish and English, which can come in handy for the type of work I do.

    <p> It is me!
